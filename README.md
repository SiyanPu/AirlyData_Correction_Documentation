# AirlyData Correction Documentation

## CREATE MODEL TUTORIAL: 
To create bias-correction models using the collocation data for each sensor, use the code and data files in this folder.
## USE MODEL TUTORIAL: 
To correct raw data with the pre-created models, use the code in this folder to get corrected data and create visualizations. 

First, place the pre-created models (.RData files) into this folder. Bias-correction models based on the two-month collocation at the South Dekalb regulatory monitoring site have been put in the folder. If you want to use bias-correction models created from other collocation data, first create them using the code in the CREATE MODEL TUTORIAL folder and put them here.  

## CORRECT ALL DATA: 
This folder includes the complete code used to create the bias-correction data for each sensor collocated at the South Dekalb site. Unlike the tutorials above, the code in this folder hasn't been accompanied by detailed comments and is only for reference.
